Now the video path, the size of a pixel in nanometers and the temporal separation between frames are given as inputs to the system.

The program now automatically calculates the number of frames.

The output is in units of nanometers and seconds.

It is also possible to resize the window where the edited video is displayed.

The code also writes a header explaining what is each one of the columns that we obtain in the csv file.
