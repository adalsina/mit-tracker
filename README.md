# mit-tracker
Subpixel resolution tracker of mitochondria in neuronal cells written in Python 3.

How to run it: 

Run the python file. Input the path file where your video is located, the size of each pixel in nanometers and the temporal separation between frames in seconds.

The program will then show the edited video and will output a csv file containing the positions (in nanometers) and the instantaneous velocity of the fluorescence centroids of each mitochondria for each frame.
